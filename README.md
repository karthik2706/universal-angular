### Installation
* `npm install` or `yarn`

### Development (Client-side only rendering)
* run `npm run start` which will start `ng serve`

### Production (also for testing SSR/Pre-rendering locally)
**`npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`** - Compiles your application and spins up a Node Express to serve your Universal application on `http://localhost:4000`.

**`npm run build:prerender && npm run serve:prerender`** - Compiles your application and prerenders your applications files, spinning up a demo http-server so you can view it on `http://localhost:8080`
**Note**: To deploy your static site to a static hosting platform you will have to deploy the `dist/browser` folder, rather than the usual `dist`

This is an evident problem with https, because if I put this env variable before nom start everything works, NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0, but it is not the solution because in this way I disable security.
